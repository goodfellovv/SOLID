# SOLID
Sandbox project for the implementation of all SOLID principles via Groovy. The project contains 5 modules with it is own Main class correspond to each principle. Modules has no link dependency between each other. Each module has simple similarity of DAO, Excel file reader and Printer for values from excel file enclosured in resources.

### SRP - Single Responsibility Principle
> A module or class should be responsible to one, and only one, actor

### OCP - Openâ€“Closed Principle
> Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification

### LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle
> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T.Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T.

### ISP - Interface Segregation Principle
> Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

### DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle
> - High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
> - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions
